        <h1>Nothing Else Matters</h1>
        So close, no matter how far<br>
        Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
        Forever trusting who we are<br>
        And nothing else matters<br><br>
        Never opened myself this way<br>
        Life is ours, we live it our way<br>
        All these words, I don't just say<br>
        And nothing else matters<br><br>
        Trust I seek and I find in you<br>
        Every day for us something new<br>
        Open mind for a different view<br>
        And nothing else matters<br><br>
        Never cared for what they do<br>
        Never cared for what they know<br>
        But I know<br><br>
        So close, no matter how far<br>
        It couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
        Forever trusting who we are<br>
        And nothing else matters<br><br>
        Never cared for what they do<br>

        Open mind for a different view<br>
        And nothing else matters<br><br>
        Never cared for what they say<br>
        Never cared for games they play<br>
        Never cared for what they do<br>
        Never cared for what they know<br>
        And I know, yeah, yeah<br><br>
        So close, no matter how far<br>
        Couldn't be much more from the heart<br>
        Forever trusting who we are<br>
        No, nothing else matters<br><br>
